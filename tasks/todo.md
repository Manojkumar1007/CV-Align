# CV-Align Investigation: How CV Evaluation Works Without an API Key

## Findings

The CV evaluation feature in CV-Align works without an external API key by using a local, open-source sentence-transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to perform text similarity analysis. The process is as follows:

1.  **CV Upload**: The user uploads a CV through the React frontend.
2.  **Text Extraction**: The FastAPI backend extracts the text from the document (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
3.  **Local AI Model**: The `rag_engine.py` service uses the `sentence-transformers` library to load the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model. This model runs entirely on the local machine and does not require an internet connection or API keys to a cloud provider.
4.  **Vector Similarity**: The model converts the CV text and the job description into numerical vectors. It then calculates the cosine similarity between these vectors to determine the match score.
5.  **Scoring**: The overall score is a weighted average of similarity scores for skills, experience, and education.
6.  **Canned Feedback**: The qualitative feedback (strengths, weaknesses, recommendations) is not generated by a large language model. Instead, it consists of pre-written strings that are selected based on the numerical scores.

This approach provides "AI-powered" features without the cost and dependency on external LLM providers.

## Task List

- [x] Investigate the frontend to understand how the CV is uploaded and the evaluation is displayed.
- [x] Trace the backend API call to identify the services involved in the evaluation process.
- [x] Analyze the `rag_engine.py` to determine the underlying AI/ML model being used.
- [x] Confirm that the model is running locally and not making external API calls.
- [x] Document the findings and explain the process to the user.
